The OTAAC is released under the MIT license, which means you can do whatever you like with the code, just be sure to pass me the improvements made ​​to the code, of course if desired. If an improvement is to benefit your own server, the choice is yours to pass. But I am accepting a coffee or lemon juice, if you really liked OTAAC... :3
